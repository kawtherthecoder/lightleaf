# lightleaf â€” Your entire garden at your fingertips

This mobile application compatible with Android phones was programmed in Java and XML using Android Studio.

lightleaf is an app that brings your entire garden to your fingertips. The application allows you to keep track of each plant in your garden and its individual watering and harvesting schedule.
This app is not only an organization tool, but a resource for gardeners to learn more about plants they are growing and have potential to grow, with an interactive Tips page.
For commercial farmers, likely to be included in the premium version for purchase, there is an additional feature to keep track of sales of harvested plants and track business growth (no pun intended!)
The personalization features of the app give users the opportunity to celebrate their garden!
